# blog
ugh fine I'll blog again after nearly a ~half-~decade. At some point this will
be well designed, backfilled (with what I can find from
  [The Archive](https://archive.org)), and frequently maintained. For now it's
  another useless "Oh god not another computer person's half started blog."

Currently using: [astro-blog-markdown](https://github.com/rodneylab/astro-blog-markdown) for the theme, so I can stick with a simple, performant static site thing that's easy to adapt.
